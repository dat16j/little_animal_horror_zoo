# Exercise: Little Animal Horror Zoo

Imagine that you are designing a computer game. The game is text based, meaning that no graphics are involved, so only a text story printed in the console.

The game is at the moment not able to take any instructions from the person who plays the game (you), but it can only do what you will code it to do. You can think of it as a “Demo” game that shows how it could be played, but in fact are not playable yet.

The game consists of 2 animals: a rabbit and a snake.
The screen consists of coordinate system with an x and y axis, 10 on each axis. So the animals can be located by the number they are on. In this text based game you can not see where the animal are at a given time, but they should “tell” it to the console, every time they have moved, like this: 

_“I am the nice rabbit, i am now standing on square 1, 3”_   
_“I am the evil snake, i am now standing on the square 3, 10”_

So both the rabbit and the snake should be able to move.
And they should both be able to tell about their position. 
The snake should be able to kill the rabbit if they are on the same coordinates. 
And the rabbit should be able to ask for mercy just before it is killed, maybe if the snake is on a neighboring square.

You here have some requirements.
We skipped the Use case Diagram, the Use Cases and the System Sequence Diagrams for now, but a Domain Model for this game could look like this:

## Domain Model

You should do this in groups 2-3 persons, and you should upload your class diagram, and your java files (all in a zip file) on fronter, before next Thursday.
